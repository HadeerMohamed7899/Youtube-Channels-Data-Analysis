## Analysis Result ( In a specific time range) 
**(1)** The most watched channel is T-series and the less watched is Adi Mira channel.

**(2)** There is a moderate positive correlation between the number of likes and the number of views, indicating that videos with more views tend to also have more likes.
However, there are some videos with a high number of views but a relatively low number of likes so views not only the measure of engagement.
